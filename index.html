            <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>

          Two of my favorite hobbies are watching football and playing video
          games. Watching football is something I enjoy because it allows me to
          relax while following the energy, teamwork, and strategies of the
          game. It also gives me a chance to connect with friends and family,
          whether we are supporting the same team or having friendly debates
          about the match. I also enjoy playing video games, which for me is
          both entertaining and mentally stimulating. Video games challenge my
          problem-solving skills, creativity, and ability to think quickly under
          pressure. They also provide a fun way to unwind after a busy day.
          Together, these hobbies give me a balance of relaxation, excitement,
          and mental engagement.

                    <h2>ASPIRATION</h2>

       <p> One of my biggest aspirations is to use technology to improve education
        in Nigeria. In the medium term, I plan to set up a consultancy and
        training hub to help universities upgrade their research portals and
        train staff and students on digital tools that improve research
        visibility. In the long term, I hope to work with policymakers to create
        a national digital education framework that ensures Nigerian
        universities remain globally competitive. While challenges like funding
        and resistance to change may arise, I believe consistent results and
        partnerships will help overcome them. My goal is simple: to make
        Nigerian research more visible, impactful, and connected to the world.
